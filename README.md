This Study Club for Splunk hands-on lab is a continuation of the three all attendee hands-on labs that we delivered in person as part of .conf22 in Las Vegas. As a participating attendee, you will be able to request an individual lab to be automatically orchestrated for you, to have an awesomely immersive experience and fully interact with the speakers, Aleem and Gregg. The video can be viewed after the conference at 

The lab will be a walkthrough of the Splunk LDAP Authentication method to integrate with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) using LDAP.

Together, we will be creating and mapping roles in Splunk to Windows AD groups. We will go through how to control access to Splunk dashboards and verify the access is working. We then will go through the backend via the command line. We will close out the session with a fireside chat where we will share observations, insights, gotchas, best practices and next steps.
We are working to allow the community to spin up the lab while watching the session later via video on demand after BSides22 has concluded. This will be super cool as part of support for our beloved Splunk community and global user groups.

We have a dedicated Study Club for Splunk Slack channel on splunk-usergroups. It is named study-club-for-splunk. The direct link is  http://splunk-slack.studyclub.community
